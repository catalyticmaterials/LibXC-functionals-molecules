# LibXC-functionals-molecules
Example of using LibXC to evaluate energies for gas reactions

Step 1. Run optimization of H₂, O₂, H₂O and H₂O₂ using HSE06. Evaluate HSE06 energy for these molecules, H, and O. Evaluate non-self consistent energies for a list of density functionals. Write evertying to an ASE database.
Step 2. Run single point for a list of given functionals. Evaluate non-self consistent energies for a list of density functionals. Write evertying to an ASE database.
Step 3. Analyse self-consistent results taking the HSE06 results as the reference.
Step 4. Analyse non-self-consistent results for taking each functional as the reference.
